Airgead-Banking-

Airgead Banking is a compound interest calculator app

Corner-Grocer-

This project combines both the C++ and Python programming languages working together under one visual studio project. The project takes an input text file with a large number of grocery items and allows the user to display information about the text file through a numbered console menu. The use of Python with C++ solves the issue of working with large unknown sets of data, playing to the strengths of python and avoiding unneccary complexities that can come from using C++.
